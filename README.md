# mach
A simple WordPress posting form which allows authors to post from the frontend at mach X speeds. It detects the title and tags automatically and submits via ajax. It is also only 3 files, normal/pure PHP/JS/CSS, and only about 5KB.

## how to use
There is only one field, a textarea. Start by typing the title in parentheses. Then type your content. Within the content feel free to hashtag words; those will become post tags. At this time you cannot set a category; it will use your blog's default category.

### example
(This is an amazing title)
But, the #content is even better!
